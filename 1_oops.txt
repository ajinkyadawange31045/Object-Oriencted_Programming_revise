OOPs ->
1. Object
2. Class
3. polymorhism
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Abstraction


1. Object 
    object class ka hi hota hai,object and variable are almost same.
    a = [1,2,3]
    object is a instance of class

2. Class
    Class is a blueprint
    blueprint of how the object will behave

    class has either data, or desciption
    camelCase -> Camel (first letter capital)
    snake case -> ajinkya_dawange (iunderscore lagta hai)
    - syntax:
    class Car: #class name should be in Pascal case (ThisISPascalCase)
    > + (public hai toh plus se represent hota hai, - private represent with minus)
    class -> object
    car  -----> Innova
    sports ---> Cricket

    object literals, available for built in classes

    methods are the functions which are inside a class
        l = []
        len(l) #it's a function,
        l.append(1)  #this is method, or function inside list class
